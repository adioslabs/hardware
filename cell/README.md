### Electrical

#### Components

See the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aLX0yPriqRYv9exc7hV8ZaoWDZZKsPV997NUnLpyvPM/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Searching for capacitors
for now we're using Kemet X7R 50V ±10% ceramic 0805s and through-hole radial capacitors

so to search go [here](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?v=399&pv14=32&pv16=2&pv16=6&FV=fff40002%2Cfff8000b&stock=1&pbfree=1&rohs=1) and then filter by capacitance

#### Power consumption

The input range of the MCP1700 is about 3.5V to absolute maximum 6.5V,
so we use 4xAAA batteries, which gives us an initial voltage of about 6.4V, and a voltage of about 4V after 1000mAh.

- MCP1700 quiescent current < 4µA
- XBee cyclic sleep current < 50µA
- Xbee transmit current < 45mA
- XBee idle/receive current < 50mA
- XBee ADC current **??**
- MCP9700 operating current < 12µA

**TODO** measure these!
- total sleeping current < 54µA
- total waking current < 100mA

So if we transmit for 5 seconds every hour, we use 193µAh per hour, so 4x1000mAh battery would last 2.4 years.

And if we transmit for 20 seconds every hour, we use 610µAh per hour, so 4x1000mAh battery would last 0.7 years.


### Mechanical

#### flat battery holder mounting

assuming symmetry, mounting hole centers are offset from left and right edges by (1.98" - 0.5") / 2 = 0.74"

terminals are offset from bottom by 0.102"

#### XBee dimensions, including *full height* of [socket](http://www.sullinscorp.com/drawings/75_1BFC_10483.pdf)

XBee is smaller than XBee-PRO, `32.94mm - 5.33mm = 27.61mm`

    24.38mm W x 27.61mm D x 9.79mm (2.79mm + 7.0mm) H
