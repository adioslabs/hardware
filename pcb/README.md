51mm W x 54mm L x 23mm (13mm + 10mm) D (assuming PC pins are clipped)

##### squat

26mm W x 53mm L x 35mm (25mm + 10mm) D


#### flat battery holder mounting

http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/2481/2481K-ND/303826

assuming symmetry, mounting hole centers are offset from left and right edges by (1.98" - 0.5") / 2 = 0.74"

terminals are offset from bottom by 0.102"


#### searching for capacitors

for now we're using Kemet X7R 50V Â±10% ceramic 0805s and through-hole radial capacitors

so to search go [here](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?v=399&pv14=32&pv16=2&pv16=6&FV=fff40002%2Cfff8000b&stock=1&pbfree=1&rohs=1) and then filter by capacitance
