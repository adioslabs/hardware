#### battery holder mounting

http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/2481/2481K-ND/303826

assuming symmetry, mounting hole centers are offset from left and right edges by (1.98" - 0.5") / 2 = 0.74"

terminals are offset from bottom by 0.102"

#### searching for capacitors

for now we're using Kemet X7R 50V Â±10% ceramic 0805s and through-hole radial capacitors

so to search go here - http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?v=399&pv14=32&pv17=5&pv16=2&pv16=6&stock=1&pbfree=1&rohs=1 - and then filter by capacitance
